<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Setup

1. Download the latest version of cOOPer [here](https://github.com/AY2122S1-CS2113T-W13-4/tp/releases).
2. Copy the JAR (.jar) file to an empty folder of your choice. This folder will be used as the *home folder* for your cOOPer application.
3. If you are using Windows, [launch the Command Prompt](https://www.lifewire.com/open-command-prompt-in-a-folder-5185505)
   in the home folder. If you are using Mac or Linux, [open a Terminal window](https://www.groovypost.com/howto/open-command-window-terminal-window-specific-folder-windows-mac-linux/#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20Terminal%20window%20from%20within%20a%20folder%20in,window%20to%20the%20selected%20folder.) 
   in the home folder.
4. Ensure that you have Java 11 or above installed or your desktop.
   1. In the Command Prompt / Terminal, enter `java -version`.
   2. You should see the following on the Command Prompt / Terminal:
   ![javaVersion.png](userGuideImages/javaVersion.png)
   3. The section enclosed in red shows you the version you currently have installed.
   4. If nothing appeared on the Command Prompt / Terminal, it most likely means you do not have Java installed on your computer. Do not worry, you can download it [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html).
5. Run cOOPer by entering `java -jar cOOPer.jar`.
6. A greeting from cOOPer should appear as such:

```
            /$$$$$$   /$$$$$$  /$$$$$$$
           /$$__  $$ /$$__  $$| $$__  $$
  /$$$$$$$| $$  \ $$| $$  \ $$| $$  \ $$ /$$$$$$   /$$$$$$
 /$$_____/| $$  | $$| $$  | $$| $$$$$$$//$$__  $$ /$$__  $$
| $$      | $$  | $$| $$  | $$| $$____/| $$$$$$$$| $$  \__/
| $$      | $$  | $$| $$  | $$| $$     | $$_____/| $$
|  $$$$$$$|  $$$$$$/|  $$$$$$/| $$     |  $$$$$$$| $$
 \_______/ \______/  \______/ |__/      \_______/|__/

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## cOOPer's Commands

‚ÑπÔ∏èHere are some things to note about cOOPer's **commands**.<br>

- Extraneous arguments for commands that do not have arguments (e.g. `exit`, `meetings`, `cf`, `help`, etc.) will be **ignored**. For example, `exit 123` will be interpreted as `exit`.<br>
- For commands having arguments, extraneous arguments added to the back of the command **will be considered as part of the command argument** too, and this may lead to the command **not being interpreted correctly** by cOOPer. For example, if `available 14:00 abc` is entered, cOOPer interprets the argument as `14:00 abc` which according to cOOPer is an invalid time.<br>
- All commands are **case-insensitive**. For example, `list` is the same as `List` or `LIST`.<br>
- Empty input (for e.g. simply pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd>, entering whitespaces or <kbd>Tab</kbd> characters) will be ignored and cOOPer will continue prompting you for your next command.<br>

‚ÑπÔ∏èHere is some additional information about cOOPer's **command prompt**.<br>

- At different stages of using cOOPer, an additional label which looks like `[label]` will appear beside the prompt.<br> 
- There are **three** types of labels you will see:
  - `[Logged out]` indicates you are currently **logged out** of cOOPer
  - `[Balance Sheet]` indicates you are using cOOPer's **[balance sheet](#creating-the-balance-sheet-bs--add) function**
  - `[Cash Flow]` indicates you are using cOOPer's **[cash flow](#creating-the-cash-flow-statement-cf--add) function**
- No label shown indicates you are **logged in** to the cOOPer, but you are using **neither** the balance sheet function nor the cash flow statement function.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Getting Started

### How cOOPer is to be used
- The **correct** way (as of v2.1) of using cOOPer is to run cOOPer on a **single** desktop with only **a single user** interacting with cOOPer at a time.
> ‚ö†Ô∏ècOOPer's features **will not work** as described in this user guide if **multiple users** are interacting with cOOPer on **multiple desktops** at the same time.

### Roles
- There are two main roles you can hold as a user of cOOPer, namely the _**admin**_ role or the _**employee**_ role.

- You are eligible to hold the admin role if you hold a high position in the startup. e.g. Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Chief Financial Officer (CFO), Human Resources Manager (HR), accountant etc.

- On the other hand, you hold the employee role if you are a basic employee at the startup.

- cOOPer offers tailor-made functions and features specific to your role to ensure the correct level of administrative access within the company throughout cOOPer's usage.

### User registration
- Upon first-time use of cOOPer, an individual holding the admin role in the startup is in charge of ensuring all members of the startup are registered with the correct role.

- Once a member has been registered, they will be able to log in to cOOPer to access its features.

- How to register a user:
  1. When you see cOOPer asking you to log in, register or exit, enter `register [username] /pw [password] /as [role]`. 
  2. Upon successful registration, you should see a message informing you of your successful registration.
  3. You can now log in to access cOOPer's features specific to your role. Refer to the [Login](#login) section to find out more about logging in.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`[username]` refers to your name, `[password]` refers to your password, while `[role]` refers to your role as determined [here](#roles).

- Example input:

```
>> [Logged out] register Sebastian /pw 123 /as admin
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
Sebastian is now successfully registered as an admin!
=========================================================================
```

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èA similar output should be observed when an employee is registered, with the output now showing 'employee' instead of 'admin'.<br>
> üí° Just like when you are using any other app with a sign in feature, remember to record down your username and password somewhere (e.g. Sticky Notes, a password manager).<br>

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#whats-in-this-user-guide)

## Login
- Once you are successfully [registered](#user-registration), you can now log in to access cOOPer's features.
- How to log in:
  1. When you see cOOPer asking you to log in, register or exit, enter `login [username] /pw [password] /as [role]`.
  2. You now have access to cOOPer's features specific to your role.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`[username]`, `[password]` and `[role]` refer to your name, password and role as registered in cOOPer's system.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏èThe username you are logging in with is **case-sensitive**. *e.g.* logging in with the username `sebastian` is not the same as logging in with `Sebastian`.

- Example input:

```
>> [Logged out] login Sebastian /pw 123 /as admin
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
You are now logged in successfully as Sebastian!
=========================================================================
```

## Features for All Users

- This section explains cOOPer's features for all users, i.e. users with either the _**admin**_ role or the _**employee**_ role. Refer to the [Roles](#roles) section if you do not know how roles are determined.
- These features are accessible to you only **after** you have successfully [logged in](#login).

## Admin Features 
This section explains cOOPer's features for specific to users, with the _**admin**_ role. Refer to the [Roles](#roles) section if you do not know how roles are determined. cOOPer will **deny** users without the admin role access to these features.

### Creating the balance sheet: `bs` ‚Üí `add`
- Fills up the different fields of cOOPer's balance sheet like 'Cash and Cash Equivalents', 'Inventory', 'Accounts Payable', 'Equity Capital', etc.
- How to create the balance sheet:
  1. Enter `bs`.
  2. cOOPer initiates the balance sheet function and prompts you to enter the first entry, 'Cash and Cash Equivalents'.
  3. Enter `add [amount]` as an unsigned integer with no brackets.
  4. `[amount]` will be added as 'Cash and Cash Equivalents' as an **asset**.
  5. cOOPer then continues prompting you for the rest of the balance sheet fields. All assets should be added without brackets, and all liabilities should be added with brackets. Shareholder's Equity can be with or without brackets. To see which fields belong where, see [here](#accessing-the-balance-sheet-bs--list).
  6. When the balance sheet is complete, cOOPer prompts the user to enter [`list`](#accessing-the-balance-sheet-bs--list) to view the complete balance sheet.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è By default, cOOPer treats `[amount]` as a positive integer. To specify a negative integer, a pair of parentheses should be added around `[amount]`. For example, `add 5000` specifies an asset of $5000 while `add (5000)` specifies a liability of $5000.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `[amount]` should be an **unsigned integer** representing the amount of assets / liabilities added as the balance sheet field.<br>
> üí°    Remember to enter `bs` before entering `add` or cOOPer will not know which financial statement to add to.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏èRunning `bs` and `add` after the balance sheet is complete will **overwrite** the current fields of the balance sheet one by one, creating a *new version* of the balance sheet. Hence, it is important to add the balance sheet fields to **completion**. <br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Any entries more than or equal to 1 Billion SGD (positive or negative) will not be added.

- Example input for initiating the balance sheet function:

```
>> bs
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
You are now using the Balance Sheet function.
You can enter 'list' to view the current Balance Sheet or
start off by entering Cash & Cash Equivalents:
=========================================================================
```

- Example input for adding to 'Cash and Cash Equivalents':

```
>> [Balance Sheet] add 1500
```

- Expected output: 

```
=========================================================================
Success!
+1500 has been added as Cash and Cash Equivalents

Next, please enter Accounts Receivable
=========================================================================
```

[‚¨ÜÔ∏è Back to top](#whats-in-this-user-guide)

### Creating the cash flow statement: `cf` ‚Üí `add`
- Fills up the different fields of cOOPer's cash flow statement like 'Net Income', 'Depreciation and Amortisation', 'Capital Expenditures', 'Dividends Paid', etc.
- How to create the cash flow statement:
  1. Enter `cf`.
  2. cOOPer initiates the cash flow statement function and prompts you to enter the first entry, 'Net Income'.
  3. Enter `add [amount]`.
  4. `[amount]` will be added as 'Net Income'.
  5. cOOPer then continues prompting you for the rest of the cash flow statement fields.
  6. When the cash flow statement is complete, cOOPer prompts the user to enter [`list`](#accessing-the-cash-flow-statement-cf--list) to view the complete cash flow statement.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è By default, cOOPer treats `[amount]` as a positive integer. To specify a negative integer, a pair of parentheses should be added around `[amount]`. For example, `add 5000` specifies an inflow of $5000 while `add (5000)` specifies an outflow of $5000.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è `[amount]` should be a **positive integer** representing the amount of inflow / outflow added as the cash flow statement field.<br>
> üí°    Remember to enter `cf` before entering `add` or cOOPer will not know which financial statement to add to.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏èRunning `cf` and `add` after the cash flow statement is complete will **overwrite** the current fields of the cash flow statement one by one, creating a *new version* of the cash flow statement. Hence, it is important to add the cash flow statement fields to **completion**. <br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è Any entries more than or equal to 1 Billion SGD (positive or negative) will not be added.

- Example input for initiating the cash flow statement function:

```
>> cf
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
You are now using the Cash Flow function.
You can enter 'list' to view the current Cash Flow Statement or
start off by entering Net Income:
=========================================================================
```

- Example input for adding to 'Net Income':


```
>> [Cash Flow] add 1500
```

- Expected output:

```
=========================================================================
Success!
+1500 has been added as Net Income

Next, please enter Depreciation and Amortisation
=========================================================================
```

### Accessing the balance sheet: `bs` ‚Üí `list`
- Displays the complete balance sheet with extra fields like 'Total Assets', 'Total Liabilities' and 'Total Shareholder's Equity'.
- Informs you if the balance sheet does not tally correctly.
- How to view the balance sheet:
  1. After [creating the balance sheet](#creating-the-balance-sheet-bs--add), cOOPer would have prompted you to enter `list` to view the balance sheet.
  2. Enter `list`.

> üí° Remember to fill up the fields of the balance sheet with `add` before entering `list`.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è`list` displays the *latest version* of the balance sheet. Refer to [this](#creating-the-balance-sheet-bs--add) section to know what *latest version* means.<br>

</p> 

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èYou **do not** need to be currently using the balance sheet function or the cash flow statement function in order to use this command. <br>
> üí°   Always [**fill up** the balance sheet](#creating-the-balance-sheet-bs--add) / [cash flow statement](#creating-the-cash-flow-statement-cf--add) first before generating it as a PDF.<br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èAs of v2.1, `generate` is only able to create **one** document for a financial statement. Entering `generate` more than one time overwrites the current PDF with the latest version of the financial statement.
>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** <br>
>- The creation of the PDF requires an **active internet connection**. 
>- In the event that there is no internet connection, a backup '.txt' file will be created in the same 'output' folder in which the PDF was supposed to be created.
>- The contents of the backup '.txt' file created can be used to recreate the PDF file with the use of an [online LaTeX Editor](https://www.overleaf.com/). <br>
>
> üí° **Always** ensure that you have an active internet connection before using the `generate` command.

### Scheduling meetings with different users: `schedule`
- cOOPer helps you to schedule meetings easily by either an **auto** or **manual** way. 
- **Auto** schedule meeting means cOOPer picks the earliest timing all specified users and yourself are available at and schedule a meeting then. 
- How to **auto** schedule a meeting:
  1. Enter `schedule [meetingName] /with [username1], [username2]`.
  2. cOOPer will find the **earliest timing** when all specified users are available.
  3. If successful, cOOPer will create a new meeting at that time. Otherwise, cOOPer will inform you that no meeting can be scheduled with the specified users.

- **Manual** schedule meeting means cOOPer goes to the timing you specified and checks if all specified users and yourself are available then, and schedules a meeting then.
- How to **manually** schedule a meeting:
  1. Enter `schedule [meetingName] /with [username1], [username2] /at [date] [time]`.
  2. cOOPer will check if the users are all available at the time specified.
  3. If successful, cOOPer will create a new meeting at that time. Otherwise, cOOPer will inform you that no meeting can be scheduled with all the users at that specified time.

> ‚ÑπÔ∏èYou do not have to enter your own `[username]` as cOOPer assumes you are in the meeting that you want to schedule. <br>
> ‚ÑπÔ∏èThere is no limit to the number of `[username]`s you can enter. cOOPer supports scheduling a meeting with a large number of users. However, a large number of users may **slow** cOOPer down.<br>
> üí°   Before you do a manual schedule, you may want to check the [`availability`](#viewing-users-available-at-different-timings-availability) table for better success rates.<br>
> ‚ö†Ô∏è`[time]` has a format of **HH:mm**, in *24-hour clock*, similar to the format [`available`](#declaring-available-timing-for-meetings-available) uses. Any other format will **not** be accepted and may result in incorrect behaviour.
> ‚ö†Ô∏è`[date]` has a format of **dd-MM-yyyy**, similar to the format [`available`](#declaring-available-timing-for-meetings-available) uses. Any other format will **not** be accepted and will result in incorrect behaviour.

- Example input for **auto** schedule meeting:

```
>> schedule Progress Meeting /with Eugene
```

- Expected output for **auto** schedule meeting:

```
=========================================================================
Success!
You have scheduled a <<Progress Meeting>> meeting at 08-11-2021 10:00 with attendees: Eugene, Sebastian
=========================================================================
```

- Example input for **manual** schedule meeting:

```
>> schedule Progress Meeting /with Eugene /at 08-11-2021 14:00
```

- Expected output for **manual** schedule meeting:

```
=========================================================================
Success!
You have scheduled a <<Project Meeting>> meeting at 08-11-2021 14:00 with attendees: Eugene, Sebastian
=========================================================================
